		<p><h3>Watches were developed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks,
		which appeared as early as the 14th century. During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, 
		driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel.
		These are called mechanical watches.[1][2] In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which 
		was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the quartz watch had 
		taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch. Historically, this is called the quartz revolution 
		(also known as quartz crisis in Switzerland).[3][4] Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches, which 
		are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist. They generally incorporate 
		timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities.<br><br>
		In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month, and year. For mechanical 
		watches, various extra features called "complications," such as moon-phase displays and the
		different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included.[5] Most electronic quartz watches, 
		on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers, chronographs and alarm 
		functions. Furthermore, some modern watches (like smartwatches) even incorporate calculators, 
		GPS[6] and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use
		radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.<br><br>

        Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements. However,
		expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship,
		aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical
		movements, even though they are less accurate and more expensive than electronic ones.[3][4][7] As of 2018, 
		the most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, 
		the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, fetching US$24 million (CHF 23,237,000) 
		in Geneva on 11 November 2014.[8][9][10][11][12] As of December 2019, the most expensive watch ever sold 
		at auction (and wristwatch) was the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010, fetching US$31.
		19 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Geneva on 9 November 2019.[13]</h3></p><br><br><br>

		<p><h3>An hourglass (or sandglass, sand timer, sand clock or egg timer)
		is a device used to measure the passage of time. It comprises two glass
		bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow
		of a substance (historically sand) from the upper bulb to the lower one.
		Typically, the upper and lower bulbs are symmetric so that the hourglass 
		will measure the same duration regardless of orientation. The specific 
		duration of time a given hourglass measures is determined by factors 
		including the quantity and coarseness of the particulate matter, the bulb 
		size, and the neck width.<h3></p>

		(i.e. in numerals or other symbols), as opposed to an analogue clock.Digital
		clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description
		refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism. (Both analogue and digital
		clocks can be driven either mechanically or electronically, but "clockwork" mechanisms

		<p><h3>The first digital pocket watch was the invention of Austrian engineer 
		Josef Pallweber[1] who created his "jump-hour" mechanism in 1883. Instead 
		of a conventional dial, the jump-hour featured two windows in an enamel dial, 
		through which the hours and minutes are visible on rotating discs. The second 
		hand remained conventional. By 1885 Pallweber mechanism was already on the market
		in pocket watches by Cortébert and IWC; arguably contributing to the subsequent rise and commercial
		success of IWC. The principles of Pallweber jump-hour movement had appeared in wristwatches by the 
		1920s (Cortébert) and are still used today (Chronoswiss Digiteur). While the original inventor didn't 
		have a watch brand at the time, his name has since been resurrected by a newly established watch manufacturer.[2]<br><br>
		Plato clocks used a similar idea but a different layout. These spring-wound pieces consisted of a glass 
		cylinder with a column inside, affixed to which were small digital cards with numbers printed on them, which 
		flipped as time passed. The Plato clocks were introduced at the St. Louis World Fair in 1904, produced 
		by Ansonia Clock Company. Eugene Fitch of New York patented the clock design in 1903.[3] 13 years earlier
		Josef Pallweber had patented the same invention using digital cards (different from his 1885 patent using
		moving disks) in Germany (DRP No. 54093).[4] The German factory Aktiengesellschaft für Uhrenfabrikation
		Lenzkirch made such digital clocks in 1893 and 1894.[5]<br><br>
		The earliest patent for a digital alarm clock was registered by D.E Protzmann
		and others on October 23, 1956, in the United States.[6] Protzmann and his
		associates also patented another digital clock in 1970, which was said to use 
		a minimal amount of moving parts. Two side-plates held digital numerals between
		them, while an electric motor and cam gear outside controlled movement.[3]
		In 1970, the first digital wristwatch with an LED display was mass-produced. 
		Called the Pulsar, and produced by the Hamilton Watch Company, this watch was hinted 
		at two years prior when the same company created a prototype digital watch for Kubrick's 2001:
		A Space Odyssey.</h3></p>

		<p><h3>A mechanical watch is a watch that uses a clockwork mechanism to measure the passage of time
		, as opposed to quartz watches which function electronically via a small battery, or radio watches,
		which are quartz watches synchronized to an atomic clock via radio waves. A mechanical watch is driven
		by a mainspring which must be wound either periodically by hand or via a self-winding mechanism. 
		Its force is transmitted through a series of gears to power the balance wheel, a weighted wheel which
		oscillates back and forth at a constant rate. A device called an escapement releases the watch's wheels 
		to move forward a small amount with each swing of the balance wheel, moving the watch's hands forward at
		a constant rate. The escapement is what makes the 'ticking' sound which is heard in an operating mechanical
		watch. Mechanical watches evolved in Europe in the 17th century from spring powered clocks, which appeared 
		in the 15th century.<br><br>
		Mechanical watches are typically not as accurate as quartz watches,[1][2][3] and they
		require periodic cleaning and calibration by a skilled watchmaker.[3] Since the 1970s, quartz watches have 
		taken over most of the watch market, and mechanical watches are now mostly a high-end product, purchased for
		their aesthetic and luxury values, for appreciation of their fine craftsmanship,[2] or as a status symbol.</h3></p><br><br>

		<p><h3>Peter Henlein has often been described as the inventor of the first pocket watch, the "Nuremberg egg",
		in 1510, but this claim appears to be a 19th-century invention and does not appear in older sources.<br><br>
		Until the quartz revolution of the 1970s, all watches were mechanical. Early watches were terribly imprecise;
		a good one could vary as much as 15 minutes in a day. Modern precision (a few seconds per day) was not attained 
		by any watch until 1760, when John Harrison created his marine chronometers. Industrialization of the movement
		manufacturing process by the Waltham Watch Company in 1854 made additional precision possible; the company won
		a gold medal at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition for their manufacturing quality.<br><br>
		Mechanical watches are powered by a mainspring. Modern mechanical watches require of the order of 1 microwatt 
		of power on average. Because the mainspring provides an uneven source of power (its torque 
		steadily decreases as the spring unwinds), watches from the early 16th century to the early 19th century 
		featured a chain-driven fusee which served to regulate the torque output of the mainspring throughout its winding.
		Unfortunately, the fusees were very brittle, were very easy to break,
		and were the source of many problems, especially inaccuracy of timekeeping when the fusee chain became loose
		or lost its velocity after the lack of maintenance.<br><br>
		As new kinds of escapements were created which served to better isolate the watch from its time source,
		the balance spring, watches could be built without a fusee and still be accurate.<br><br>
		In the 18th century the original verge escapement, which required a fusee, was gradually replaced 
		in better French watches with the cylinder escapement, and in British watches with the duplex escapement.
		Then in the 19th century both were superseded by the lever escapement which has been used 
		almost exclusively ever since. A cheaper version of the lever, the pin lever escapement, patented
		in 1867 by Georges Frederic Roskopf was used in inexpensive watches until the 1970s.<br><br>
		As manual-wound mechanical watches became less popular and less favored in the 1970s,
		watch design and industrialists came out with the automatic watch. Whereas a mechanically-wound
		watch must be wound with the pendant or a levered setting, an automatic watch does not need to be 
		wound by the pendant; simply rotating the watch winds the watch automatically. The interior of an 
		automatic watch houses a swiveling metal or brass "plate" that swivels on its axis when the watch
		is shaken horizontally.</h3></p><br><br><br>
